=== Maps

Let's play with maps. What is the result of the following

[source,elixir]
----
iex -S mix

%{"name" => "Anna", "age" => 23}

%{1 => 2, 2 => 3}

w1 = %{:weather => :snow}

w1[:weather]

w1[:keepfocus]

Syntactic sugar for maps with atoms.
What is the difference between these two?

[source,elixir]
----

%{:name => "Anna"}
%{"name" => "Anna"}
----

=== Pattern Matching

Play with pattern matching.

[source,elixir]
----
iex -S mix

iex(1)> alias ElevatorBattle.Part0.Person
iex(2)> person = %{name: "Anna", age: 23}
----

What is the result of the following two queries?

[source,elixir]
----
person[:name]

person[:age]
----


What is the result of the following two queries?

[source,elixir]
----
Person.name(person)

Person.age(person)
----

What do you think this commands does?

[source,elixir]
----
iex(7)> IEx.Helpers.recompile

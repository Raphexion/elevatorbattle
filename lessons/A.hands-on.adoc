#
w1 = %{:weather => :snow}

Syntactic sugar for maps with atoms

[source,elixir]
----
# What is the difference between these two

%{"name" => "Anna"}

=== Pattern Matching

Play with pattern matching.

[source,elixir]
----
iex -S mix

iex(1)> alias ElevatorBattle.Part0.Person
iex(2)> person = %{name: "Anna", age: 23}

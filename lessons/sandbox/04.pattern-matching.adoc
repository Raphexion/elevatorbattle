== Pattern Matching

Elixir has deep roots in logic programming (prolog).
One amazing feature from these roots is *pattern matching*.

This concept is very easy but can be hard for beginners.
The key problem is the equal sign (`=`).

We are used to write:

[source,elixir]
----
x = 1
y = 41
z = x + y
----

Which is perfectly fine in Elixir.
However, we can also write:

[source,elixir]
----
{:ok, name} = {:ok, "Anna"}  # name assigned to "Anna"
{x, y, z} = {1, 2, :snow}    # x = 1
                             # y = 2
			     # z = 3
----

If it *doesn't match* we get an error.
For example:

[source,elixir]
----
{:ok, name} = {:error, :name_missing}

** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value:
{:error, :name_missing}
----

This sets us up for *pattern matching*.
Pattern matching can be done anywhere.

Let's start with pattern matching that is similar to
the normal case statement.

NOTE: IO.puts is Elixir's print statement

[source,elixir]
----
case res of
  {:ok, name} ->
    IO.puts "Her name was #{name}"

  {:error, :name_missing} ->
    IO.puts "No name found"

  _ ->
    IO.puts "Unknown error"
end
----

However, when pattern matchin really shines is in functions.
This is one of the absolutely magics of Elixir.

We can overload functions with pattern matching.

[source,elixir]
----
def process_name({:ok, name}) do
  IO.puts "Her name was #{name}"
end

def process_name({:error, :name_missing}) do
  IO.puts "No name found"
end

def process_name(_) do
  IO.puts "Unknown error"
end
----

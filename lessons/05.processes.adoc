== Process

Processes are first-class-citizens in Elixir.
In object oriented languages we model the word with classes and objects (Java).

In Elixir it is very cheap to start and run processes.
This is because processes are *green threads*.
Which means that they are scheduled by the virtual machine and not the operating system.

It is trial to start a new thread.
This is done with the `spawn` keyword.

However, let's first introduce anonymous functions (functions without names).

[source,elixir]
----
# define the function
f1 = fun x, y -> x + y + 1 end

# call the function
f1.(1, 2)  # 4
----

We can also make anonymous functions that take zero arguments.

[source,elixir]
----
# define the function
f0 = fn -> IO.puts "Hello from the other side" end

# call the function
f0.()
Hello from the other side
----


=== Spawning our first function

Let's spawn our first function

[source,elixir]
----
# first we define the function
printer = fn -> IO.puts "my pid: #{inspect self()}"

# we run it a couple of times to see that we get the same result
printer.()
my pid: #PID<0.103.0>

printer.()
my pid: #PID<0.103.0>

printer.()
my pid: #PID<0.103.0>

# then we run it in another process
spawn(printer)
my pid: #PID<0.139.0>

spawn(printer)
my pid: #PID<0.141.0>

spawn(printer)
my pid: #PID<0.143.0>
